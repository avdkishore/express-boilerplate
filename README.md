# Product details and checkout

A simple checkout system written in node.js

## Requirements

* NODE: `>= 10`
* YARN: `1.9.4`
* POSTGRES: `9.6`
* DATABASE: `till_pos_product`

## Setup

```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/avdkishore/pos-checkout.git && cd pos-checkout

# install the dependencies
yarn

# start the project
yarn start
```

* This starts the server on the port 5200
* database seeds are located in `/src/sql/seeds`. These need to be run in the database

## TODO

Setup tests
